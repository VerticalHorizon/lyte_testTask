It's the biggest product conference in the world</STRONG><BR>Mind the Product San Francisco 2018 brought together 1,600 passionate product people into one space on one day and we expect the same in 2019. There's no bigger event dedicated to product out there. Not only is our crowd the biggest, but we draw the greatest names in product too.</P>\n<P><STRONG>2. Hear real, practical advice you can put to work the next day as well as inspirational ideas on the future of product development and design</STRONG><BR><SPAN>We think that a balance is important for a great day of learning. Our speakers are visionaries for the future of product, but they've also got tons of real experience under their belts to pass onto you.</SPAN></P>\n<P><STRONG>3. Network with a conference full of passionate peers over free lunch and great coffee</STRONG><BR>OK, so it's a little bit about the coffee. We take care of you all day with plenty to chow down on while you discuss everything you've seen and heard. One of the best bits about Mind the Product is that we offer a single-track experience. No matter who you bump into, you've got the same interesting things to talk about.</P>\n<P><STRONG>4. Build a real community with your product tribe</STRONG><BR>Mind the Product isn't just a conference; it's a round-the-year blog and community with chapters in 160+ cities around the world that's dedicated to building a tribe around the art of product. We want product people around the world to come to meet with us and each other, so that we can all become the best in our field and move our discipline forward.</P>\n<P><STRONG>5. Enjoy the industry party of the year for great food and free flowing drinks &amp; conversation</STRONG><BR>Getting together with your industry peers should not just be inspiring and educational, but good fun. We don't hold back on putting on an excellent party (with an open bar and some delicious food) to keep the conversation flowing and help you to build great connections with your product community.</P>\n<H2>\u00a0</H2>\n<P><BR></P>\n<HR>\n<H2>Frequently Asked Questions</H2>\n<P><STRONG>Do you offer discounts for students, startups, non-profits, etc?<BR></STRONG>The only discounts we offer are the Early Bird conference tickets (limit one ticket per order), which sell out in a matter of minutes, and the group discounts on General Release conference tickets where we do a 10% discount on 10 or more tickets.

It's the biggest product conference in the worldMind the Product San Francisco 2018 brought together 1,600 passionate product people into one space on one day and we expect the same in 2019. There's no bigger event dedicated to product out there. Not only is our crowd the biggest, but we draw the greatest names in product too.\n2. Hear real, practical advice you can put to work the next day as well as inspirational ideas on the future of product development and designWe think that a balance is important for a great day of learning. Our speakers are visionaries for the future of product, but they've also got tons of real experience under their belts to pass onto you.\n3. Network with a conference full of passionate peers over free lunch and great coffeeOK, so it's a little bit about the coffee. We take care of you all day with plenty to chow down on while you discuss everything you've seen and heard. One of the best bits about Mind the Product is that we offer a single-track experience. No matter who you bump into, you've got the same interesting things to talk about.\n4. Build a real community with your product tribeMind the Product isn't just a conference; it's a round-the-year blog and community with chapters in 160+ cities around the world that's dedicated to building a tribe around the art of product. We want product people around the world to come to meet with us and each other, so that we can all become the best in our field and move our discipline forward.\n5. Enjoy the industry party of the year for great food and free flowing drinks & conversationGetting together with your industry peers should not just be inspiring and educational, but good fun. We don't hold back on putting on an excellent party (with an open bar and some delicious food) to keep the conversation flowing and help you to build great connections with your product community.\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDo you offer discounts for students, startups, non-profits, etc?The only discounts we offer are the Early Bird conference tickets (limit one ticket per order), which sell out in a matter of minutes, and the group discounts on General Release conference tickets where we do a 10% discount on 10 or more tickets.

Appearing on \"Oleic\" through Owens' rework of her track 'Kingsize,' avant-pop artist Jenny Hval also appears on S/T on the stunning \"Anxi,\" a track that shifts from drifting tones and distant vocals to warm squelches and tunnel-vision club beats. \"It has been my most freeing and open collaboration so far, and my first time working with a female,\" Owens says of working with Hval. \"It was a very powerful experience for me, I felt she brought something strange and quite beautiful.\"<BR> <BR> S/T is first and foremost Owens' vision, a record that exudes a startling level of intimacy even in its largest-sounding moments -- such as \"Arthur,\" a percolating mixture of looped vocals and rustling rhythms that rides on a perpetual near-crescendo. The song is a tribute to the late iconoclastic musician and kindred spirit Arthur Russell: \"He wrote music and stayed true to his vision up until the day he died, \" Owens explains. \"He didn't compromise as an artist, and those are the kind of people I look up to -- people who know what they want.\" On S/T Owens translates that self-assertiveness into a record that explores a variety of moods -- sadness, anxiety, darkly shaded ecstasy -- with a trippy-eyed clarity and confidence that only bodes well for the future.</P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"text-align: center;\"><A HREF=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<iframe width=\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;<IMG ALT=\"\" SRC=\"https://s.evbuc.com/https_proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.youtube.com%2Fvi%2F%253Ciframe%2520width%3D&sig=ADR2i7_s001OVYEg1M7TE0OTtmqYbV6YaQ\">/maxresdefault.jpg\" border=0 width=600&gt;</IMG></A></P>\r\n<P>\u2014 FREE w/ RSVP \u2014</P>\r\n<P>FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE \u2014 RSVP\u2019s end once we hit capacity</P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P STYLE=\"text-align: center;\"><STRONG><BR><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\">Tickets:</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: x-large;\">\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.

Appearing on \"Oleic\" through Owens' rework of her track 'Kingsize,' avant-pop artist Jenny Hval also appears on S/T on the stunning \"Anxi,\" a track that shifts from drifting tones and distant vocals to warm squelches and tunnel-vision club beats. \"It has been my most freeing and open collaboration so far, and my first time working with a female,\" Owens says of working with Hval. \"It was a very powerful experience for me, I felt she brought something strange and quite beautiful.\"  S/T is first and foremost Owens' vision, a record that exudes a startling level of intimacy even in its largest-sounding moments -- such as \"Arthur,\" a percolating mixture of looped vocals and rustling rhythms that rides on a perpetual near-crescendo. The song is a tribute to the late iconoclastic musician and kindred spirit Arthur Russell: \"He wrote music and stayed true to his vision up until the day he died, \" Owens explains. \"He didn't compromise as an artist, and those are the kind of people I look up to -- people who know what they want.\" On S/T Owens translates that self-assertiveness into a record that explores a variety of moods -- sadness, anxiety, darkly shaded ecstasy -- with a trippy-eyed clarity and confidence that only bodes well for the future.\r\n\" target=\"_blank\">/maxresdefault.jpg\" border=0 width=600>\r\n\u2014 FREE w/ RSVP \u2014\r\nFIRST COME, FIRST SERVE \u2014 RSVP\u2019s end once we hit capacity\r\n\r\nTickets:\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.

Since making his solo debut with the acclaimed mixtape Earl (2010), he has placed his first two albums, Doris (2013) and the seriously (and descriptively) titled I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside (2015), in the upper reaches of the Billboard 200 chart. By the time he released his third album, Some Rap Songs (2018), Earl had either produced or appeared on tracks by most of the Odd Future affiliates, including Tyler, The Creator and Frank Ocean, as well as similarly left-field artists such as Danny Brown and Denmark Vessey.<BR> <BR> Born Thebe Kgositsile in Chicago, Illinois, Earl Sweatshirt was known as Sly Tendencies until 2009, the year the Los Angeles-based rapper and producer was invited by Tyler, The Creator to join Odd Future. In March 2010, at the age of 16, he debuted with Earl, a mixtape that garnered critical acclaim, but he was subsequently sent to a Samoan boarding school by his mother. Upon his 2012 return to L.A., determined to build on the success of the tape, he eased himself back into the scene with a number of collaborations, most notably appearances on Odd Future's The OF Tape, Vol. 2 and Frank Ocean's Grammy-winning Channel Orange. Earl ultimately signed a solo deal with Columbia, enabling him to issue material on the major label through the vanity imprint Tan Cressida, and in November 2012 initiated the long-term affiliation with the single \"Chum.\" \"Whoa\" and \"Hive,\" the former of which became Earl's first charting solo track -- peaking on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart at number 46 -- led to the August 2013 release of Doris. Enhanced with input from numerous OF associates and the likes of the Neptunes, Frank Ocean, and the RZA -- though Earl also produced much of the set -- the album entered the Billboard 200 at number five. Publications ranging from Rolling Stone to The Wire included it in their respective year-end lists of best albums.<BR> <BR> After a handful of collaborations, Earl returned in March 2015 with I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside, an album only half-an-hour in length but received as a major follow-up for its artfully insular quality. Earl handled the production on all but one track of the album, a number 12 Billboard 200 hit. Between solo releases, Earl popped up on a handful of tracks, including Danny Brown's \"Really Doe,\" and expanded his production discography with a number of one-offs, as well as extensive work with Mach-Hommy and Denmark Vessey. Earl released his third LP for Columbia, Some Rap Songs, in November 2018. The album arrived following the death of his father, South African poet and activist Keorapetse Kgositsile (aka Bra Willie).</P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"text-align: center;\"><A HREF=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<iframe width=\" REL=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><BR></A></P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P STYLE=\"text-align: center;\"><STRONG><BR><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;\">Tickets:</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: x-large;\">\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.

Since making his solo debut with the acclaimed mixtape Earl (2010), he has placed his first two albums, Doris (2013) and the seriously (and descriptively) titled I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside (2015), in the upper reaches of the Billboard 200 chart. By the time he released his third album, Some Rap Songs (2018), Earl had either produced or appeared on tracks by most of the Odd Future affiliates, including Tyler, The Creator and Frank Ocean, as well as similarly left-field artists such as Danny Brown and Denmark Vessey.  Born Thebe Kgositsile in Chicago, Illinois, Earl Sweatshirt was known as Sly Tendencies until 2009, the year the Los Angeles-based rapper and producer was invited by Tyler, The Creator to join Odd Future. In March 2010, at the age of 16, he debuted with Earl, a mixtape that garnered critical acclaim, but he was subsequently sent to a Samoan boarding school by his mother. Upon his 2012 return to L.A., determined to build on the success of the tape, he eased himself back into the scene with a number of collaborations, most notably appearances on Odd Future's The OF Tape, Vol. 2 and Frank Ocean's Grammy-winning Channel Orange. Earl ultimately signed a solo deal with Columbia, enabling him to issue material on the major label through the vanity imprint Tan Cressida, and in November 2012 initiated the long-term affiliation with the single \"Chum.\" \"Whoa\" and \"Hive,\" the former of which became Earl's first charting solo track -- peaking on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart at number 46 -- led to the August 2013 release of Doris. Enhanced with input from numerous OF associates and the likes of the Neptunes, Frank Ocean, and the RZA -- though Earl also produced much of the set -- the album entered the Billboard 200 at number five. Publications ranging from Rolling Stone to The Wire included it in their respective year-end lists of best albums.  After a handful of collaborations, Earl returned in March 2015 with I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside, an album only half-an-hour in length but received as a major follow-up for its artfully insular quality. Earl handled the production on all but one track of the album, a number 12 Billboard 200 hit. Between solo releases, Earl popped up on a handful of tracks, including Danny Brown's \"Really Doe,\" and expanded his production discography with a number of one-offs, as well as extensive work with Mach-Hommy and Denmark Vessey. Earl released his third LP for Columbia, Some Rap Songs, in November 2018. The album arrived following the death of his father, South African poet and activist Keorapetse Kgositsile (aka Bra Willie).\r\n\r\n\r\nTickets:\u00a0After purchasing a ticket through Eventbrite, you will receive an email with your tickets attached as a PDF.
