Be sure to Bring Your Benjamins to make it rain on our crew of talented go-go dancers.</P>\n<P><SPAN>We\u2019ve got fabulous vibes with live music by Copyslut, Salami Rose Joe Louis, Freddie Fiers, Kooleidoscope, El Primo Inocente, and a special guest stand up comedy set by silver tongued Reiko Rasch.</SPAN></P>\n<P><STRONG>Fun Fact:</STRONG><SPAN> Sex work is hella queer! In many ways, workers within the sex industry flip the script and challenge compulsory heteronormativity. Also, many of us hoes are, in the traditional sense, simply gay AF. It wasn\u2019t long ago that being gay was criminalized - sex workers endure much of the same kind of stigma and repression today. Least we forget that the queer liberation movement as we know it today would not have been possible without the fierce POC trans women sex workers on the front lines at Stonewall. St. James Infirmary, an SF based non profit providing direct services to sex workers, will be tabling at the event.</SPAN></P>\n<P><SPAN>We can't imagine a better way to celebrate SF Pride than by supporting our community of Houseless Queer/ Trans SF Youth. All proceeds of this show will go to </SPAN><SPAN>San Francisco based Homeless Youth Alliance. They provide direct services to homeless youth in SF ages 13-29, most of whom are queer. They will be using our proceeds from this event to help their trans youth access gender affirming surgeries.

                "text": "Sex Work Is Gay: PRIDE Benefit Show\nFuck you, pay me. Join us for SF Pride 2019. It\u2019s a celebration of hoe magic, shapeshifting, and all around sexy times. Get your mack on after Dyke March at and get ready for some sweet lovin\u2019 and inter-communal healing. Be sure to Bring Your Benjamins to make it rain on our crew of talented go-go dancers.\nWe\u2019ve got fabulous vibes with live music by Copyslut, Salami Rose Joe Louis, Freddie Fiers, Kooleidoscope, El Primo Inocente, and a special guest stand up comedy set by silver tongued Reiko Rasch.\nFun Fact: Sex work is hella queer! In many ways, workers within the sex industry flip the script and challenge compulsory heteronormativity. Also, many of us hoes are, in the traditional sense, simply gay AF. It wasn\u2019t long ago that being gay was criminalized - sex workers endure much of the same kind of stigma and repression today. Least we forget that the queer liberation movement as we know it today would not have been possible without the fierce POC trans women sex workers on the front lines at Stonewall. St. James Infirmary, an SF based non profit providing direct services to sex workers, will be tabling at the event.\nWe can't imagine a better way to celebrate SF Pride than by supporting our community of Houseless Queer/ Trans SF Youth. All proceeds of this show will go to San Francisco based Homeless Youth Alliance. They provide direct services to homeless youth in SF ages 13-29, most of whom are queer. They will be using our proceeds from this event to help their trans youth access gender affirming surgeries. If you\u2019d like to learn more about them, you can check them out here: http://www.homelessyouthalliance.org/\nHashtags: #swigbenefit #swig2019 #swigsf\n\nCopyslut\nCopyslut is a four piece cabaret rock band based in Oakland, CA that blends powerful vocals with groovy riffs and an explosive vulnerability. Onstage they bring audiences into a fiery cabaret of hoe magic and gender bending. Their song writing merges art pop and heavy metal with a theatrical edge. They play to make you feel good and create experiences of radical healing through pleasure.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-829758949/sets/flirty-thirty-soundtrack\nThey recently recorded a soundtrack for an independent short film. They are currently in the recording studio working on their debut album and will be celebrating the release of their first single at Sex Work is Gay!\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/copyslutband\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/copyslutband\n\nSalami Rose Joe Louis\nSalami Rose Joe Louis is a multi-instrumentalist female producer from California and a recent signee to Flying Lotus\u2019s independent label Brainfeeder. Drawing influences from jazz, soul, hip-hop, Shuggie Otis, Captain Beefheart, Stereolab, and R. Stevie Moore, she creates a blend of experimental dreamy sounds with jazz influenced vocals and piano. Drawing from her studies in planetary sciences, she creates a celestial experience filled with space inspired sounds and galaxy chords.\nhttps://salamirosejoelouismusic.bandcamp.com\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFreddie Fiers\nFreddie Fiers (pronounced Fierce) has submerged herself into the industry of house music, perpetually evolving her technique and sound into a unique experience everywhere she goes. Her transformative spirit has taken her across America, Europe, and Far East Asia. She currently DJs at Beau for Vamp Mondays.\nfreddiefiers.com \n\nReiko Rasch\nReiko Rasch is an SF/Bay Area based Mixed race loving Libra dishing up sex worker moves and some belly laughs with her magnetic story telling abilities and sharper than nails wit.
