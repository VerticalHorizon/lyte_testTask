# Lyte TestTask

1. Create a new web application using django

2. Scrape the Eventbrite API for public events

    https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/endpoints/events/

    Don't scrape everything (unless you want to) just scrape enough to finish the rest of the project.

3. Store and/or structure the events that you scrape into your django application

4. Inside your django app, create a searchable api endpoint (returns json) allow the api request to search for event name, event start date, organizer name, ticket cost.

5. Inside your application, create 1 API endpoint that accepts json that allows a user to update the locally stored event record, create some arbitrary validations.

6. Send us the code and the url to your hosted application.
